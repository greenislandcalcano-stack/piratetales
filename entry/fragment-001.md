If you are reading this,  
the sea has already seen you.

Do not trust the maps you are given.  
They were drawn by men who survived —  
not by those who told the truth.

Every flag lies.  
Every crown takes.  
Every legend leaves something buried.

I sailed for gold.  
I stayed for blood.  
I remained because I learned too much.

There are islands that remember names.  
There are waters that return debts.  
There are crews that never died —  
only changed.

If you wish to leave,  
close this page now.

If you wish to continue,  
understand this:

**The stories do not belong to you.  
You belong to them.**

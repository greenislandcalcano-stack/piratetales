# The World

Pirate Tales is a transmedia archive of a world that refuses to stay buried.
Its legend unfolds through books and artifacts—maps, logs, letters, and recovered fragments—each piece a surviving witness, each witness incomplete. Contradictions are not errors; they are evidence. The canon is the world itself: its rules, its tides, its debts, and the consequences that follow those who enter. You may begin anywhere, but the sea will connect what you find—and it will remember you.

Artifacts recovered so far:
